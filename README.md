===========

###What's Safari Feed?

Safari feed gives you real-time updates of what is happening in the [San Diego Zoo](http://www.sandiegozoo.org/). Submit your own updates to let others know where the action is.

###Updates

Anyone within the zoo can post updates on what is happening around them.

- :) The lions are out!
- :( The monkey cage is empty.

Updates are then immediately updated on the map in real-time for anyone who has Safari-feed open.

###History

Safari Feed also has a historic heatmap layer showing all past positive activity for the current hour. That way you can see which areas of the zoo typically have the most going on when you are there. Maybe the capuchin monkeys always eat at the same time.
